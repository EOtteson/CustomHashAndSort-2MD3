# CustomHashAndSort-2MD3
Implementation of a custom hash table, hash function, and quick sort algorithm in C++ to input two files full of random words and output a file with common words sorted in alphabetical order. The program was designed to be as fast, scalable, and efficient as possible using all of the knowledge from this data structures and algorithms course. The objective of this program is to read words from a text file named "f1.txt" with one word per line and store these words in a hash table. Then a second file of the same format named "f2.txt" is read and any common words found in the hash table are pushed to a vector. This vector is then sorted using a custom quick-sort algorithm and output in alphabetical order to a file of the same format named "out.txt". A user interface was not included in the program, therefore to use different input files a change must be made in the code. The various text files in this repo are different possible input files. Additional justification is included in a comment at the top of the code.
